This is not necessarily the same as the update period. The measurement repetition time can range from milliseconds up to hours. An example for a measurement repetition time in the range of milliseconds is the sampling rate of an ECG. An example for a measurement repetition time in the range of hours is a NIBP that is triggered automatically every hour.

This is used when there is no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location. There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.","$ref":"#/definitions/Identifier","type":"object"},"display":{"description":"Plain text narrative that identifies the resource in addition to the resource reference.","type":"string"}}},"Timing":{"description":"Specifies an event that may occur multiple times.
