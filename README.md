## Production
[fhir/fhir-configuration](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-configuration) uses `NODE_ENV` to find a configuration file under `config/`. After updating `config/production.js` you can run 

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## Contributing

To contribute PRs for these generators, you will need to clone the repo
then inside the repo's directory, run `npm link`. This sets up a global
link to your local package for running tests (`npm test`) and generating
new fhir apps/services/hooks/etc.

When finished testing, optionally run `npm uninstall fhir-framework` to remove
the link.
